The initial email works, but no other emails do. And for text message workflows, no text workflows work AT ALL! And yes, I know the event should be booked for at least 1 hour for this to execute. I have made sure there's enough time for the meeting. And yes, I am on the team plan as well.\r\n\r\nThis is extremely frustrating and is making me consider going back to Calendly, as I never had this major issue with them. If the workflows do not work, I close no clients. It's a massive bug that needs fixing and fast!\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n\r\n### Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe booker is receiving the email confirmation and the first email from my sequence. But no other workflows are being executed.\r\n\r\n### Expected Results\r\n\r\nAll my bookers should receive automated text and email reminders.\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\n- Browser version, screen recording, console logs, network requests: You can make a recording with [Bird Eats Bug](https://birdeatsbug.com/).\r\n- Node.js version\r\n- Anything else that you think could be an issue.\r\n\r\n### Evidence\r\n\r\n- I spoke about this with Milos from the support team and shared my screen to explain this, and he also thinks this is a bug as he himself tried booking a call, and the workflows simply did not execute.\r\n",

Right now, I own two companies, and I want to use two different custom domain emails as our calendars where we want team meetings to be booked. But I simply... CANNOT!\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Provide a clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCal.com has been the closest to making this happen so far as it allows me to add events to a separate calendar, BUT this feature is only available for personal events (and not team events). Reference: https://cal.com/blog/v-3-8\r\n\r\nTeam events still only allow events to be added to the default calendar. This is such a bummer, and I feel it is a feature that Cal can achieve very easily. If this was allowed in team events, one account in Cal.com would enable entrepreneurs like myself who own multiple businesses to manage all calendars from one account. You can charge a higher price if needed, but this would be a very handy feature.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Let us know about other solutions you've tried or researched.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Is there anything else you can add about the proposal?\r\n  You might want to link to related issues here, if you haven't already.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://cal.com/blog/v-3-8\r\n\r\n### Requirement/Document\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Is there any type of document that could support that feature?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##### House rules\r\n\r\n- If this issue has a `\ud83d\udea8 needs approval` label, don't start coding yet.
